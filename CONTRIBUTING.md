* Follow the Python style guides
* Include tests for new features
* Update documentation for changes
* End all files with a newline
* Follow semantic commit messages

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run the test suite
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/gweidart/pyplexityai.git
cd pyplexityai

# Create virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

* **uv** for python version management, dependency, and virtual environment management
* **ruff** for linting and formatting
* **pyright** for static type checking

```bash
# Run all checks
ruff check . --fix --unsafe-fixes
ruff format .
pyright .
```

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

* `feat:` new feature
* `fix:` bug fix
* `docs:` documentation only changes
* `style:` formatting, missing semi colons, etc
* `refactor:` code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* `perf:` code change that improves performance
* `test:` adding missing tests
* `chore:` updating grunt tasks etc

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
python test.py

# Run specific test file
python test.py test_errors.py

# Run with coverage
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report
```
